42- --- NPM scripts:

we can define some custom scripts that help us run some tasks. using the npm scripts but how:

1- go to the project dir and run the command:
  $ npm init
   you will be prompt to answer questions, answer it or press enter to get the default values.
   this will create the package.json file = configration file.
   in this file there is a scripts section use it to create our own scripts.
   EX:
   add the key name "start": "node app.js", start is a spcial key used by node it self
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "some_key": "comand to be excuted",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "start-server": "node app.js"
  },
  how to use that:
  in the terminal write the following formula:
  if the key is special like start as follows
    $ npm key_in_scripts_section
    $ npm start
  if the key is not special special like start-server (custom key) as follows
    $ npm run custom_key
    $ npm run start-server

43- --- Installing 3rd Party Packages

use npm to install 3rd Packages:
$ npm install package_name --save (istall it as production dependency in this project)
$ npm install package_name --save-dev (istall it as development dependency in this project)
$ npm install package_name -g (istall it globaly can be used every where on your maschine)

the first time you install a package:
1- this add the package to the package.json as entry.
2- load the package and its dependency in node_module folder in the project root.
3- create package_lock.json

try it by installing: nodemon

45- --- Using Nodemon for Autorestart
  simply in the sicripts section in packges.json in start key use the nodemon command instead node:

  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js",
  },

  if you run the command in the terminal:
  $ nodemon app.js
  it would not work because the terminal search for the command globaly, 
  but we installed it localy for this project

47- --- Understanding different Error Types

1- Syntax Error:
2- Runtime Error:
3- Logical Errors:
 no error message but the app does not work the way it should
